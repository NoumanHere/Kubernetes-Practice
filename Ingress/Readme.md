### What is Nginx Ingress Controller
What is an ingress controller to understand we have to look at the fundamentals of web traffic and system every system whether it's a single application or a bunch of micro services has an entry point for receiving traffic this entry point can accept traffic in the form of a URL a protocol hostname or DNS and a path sometimes even a port number this end point is usually identified by either a DNS or an IP address so traffic comes in now some calls thus approxi and a load balancer or an API gateway but it doesn't matter this is an ingress controller an ingress controller is responsible for a few potential thing like accepting or denying HTTP traffic SSL termination meaning we can accept traffic on port 443 via TLS but then we may not need TLS and route to different port to reach private applications 
Routing so basically deciding where traffic should go 
URL writing so deciding where traffic should go based on the URL path and 
Load balancing so we can decide whether we want 60% of traffic to go to service a or instance a and 40% of traffic to go to service B or instance B now 
Ingress controllers under the hood can be powered by many products such as engine X H a proxy invoice traffic conch and so forth every one of these products have a different configuration their own syntax and generally require their own expertise to manage ingress controllers allow us to speak the same language so what if we took the syntax of each one of these products and made that all the same in this case kubernetes Peaks y ml so ingress controllers accept their gamal in the form of an ingress one ingress controller can accept many ingresses in an ingress we simply describe the host dns we expect traffic on we say whether we want SSL the path we want to route based on and where we would like that traffic to go the rest really doesn't matter kubernetes will translate this into the syntax for the product.
